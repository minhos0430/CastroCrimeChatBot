#Castro Crime ChatBot Project

Welcome to the Open-Source Repository for our project: Castro Crime Chatbot

This repo will aim to achieve the following:
    . Journal understanding of AI/ML Related Projects
    . Upload code and experiments
    . Store and Analyze Results
**Purpose**
    . Our goal is to develop this application and launch it for the sake of entertainment and good practice of open source software engineering and applied Artificial Intelligence.  

**Learning Focus**
    .Understanding design/training AI/ML applications
    .Practice of open-source distributed workflow projects
    .Learn more and Fail as much as we can 

****Project GuideLines
    . We will apply good open source software practices such as descriptive commits and the maintenance of a clean commit history that's easy to travel and read. 
    . We will focus on always updating the "Project Status" file inside the Castro-Crime-Chatbot/docs so it displays the project state relative ot the latest commit. We will also have a file dedicated to journaling progress to simplify the flow of information inside of our distributed workflow as all contributors live in different countries around the globe. 
    . Code should be legible and organized, optimized to the highest level of our current understanding of software engineering practices.
